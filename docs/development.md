# Development

You only need to go through this is you want to make changes to the account contract

### Setup

We recommend you to install scarb through ASDF. Please refer to [these instructions](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#install-via-asdf).\
Thanks to the [.tool-versions file](../.tool-versions/), you don't need to install a specific scarb or starknet foundry version. The correct one will be automatically downloaded and installed.\
You need also to install the Universal-Sierra-Compiler (USC) please refer to [these instructions](https://github.com/software-mansion/universal-sierra-compiler).

## Test the contracts (Cairo)

```
scarb test
```

## Test the contracts (JavaScript)

### Install the devnet (run in project root folder)

You should have docker installed in your machine then you can start the devnet by running the following command:

```shell
scarb run start-devnet
```

### Install JS dependencies

Install all packages:

```shell
yarn
```

Run all integration tests:

```shell
scarb run test-ts
```

Run single integration test file (need to run previous command first):

```shell
yarn mocha ./tests/accountEscape.test.ts
```

You also have access to the linter and a code formatter:

```shell
scarb run lint
scarb run format
```

### Contract fixtures

The [fixtures folder](tests-integration/fixtures/) contains pre-compiled contracts used for tests (both json and casm).

### Interface IDs

For compatibility reasons we support legacy interface IDs. But new interface IDs will follow [SNIP-5](https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs/blob/main/SNIPS/snip-5.md#how-interfaces-are-identified) Tool to calculate interface IDs: https://github.com/ericnordelo/src5-rs

## Release checklist

* Bump version if needed (new deployment in mainnet)
* Set up your .env file with the deployer info and run `scarb run deploy-account` and `scarb run deploy-multisig` to declare the accounts
* Verify the contracts if possible
* Deploy to as many environments as possible: mainnet, sepolia and integration
* Update the contents of the `deployments` folder with the new addresses
* Copy relevant build artifacts from `target/release` to `deployments/artifacts`, include abi file.
* Tag the commit used for the release (include the same name as in the `deployments` folder for easy tracking)
* Create release in GitHub if needed
* Make this checklist better if you learned something during the process
