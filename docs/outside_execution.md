# Outside Execution (SNIP-9)

Both the argent [account](argent_account.md) and the [multisig](multisig.md) v0.2.0 support SNIP-9. That allows meta-transactions by leveraging offchain signatures

We implement both version 1 and 2 of [SNIP-9](https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs/blob/main/SNIPS/snip-9.md)

There are some example about how to use this feature [here](../lib/outsideExecution.ts) and [here](../tests-integration/)
