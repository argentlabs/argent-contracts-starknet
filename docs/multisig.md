# Argent Multisig

## High-Level Specification

The Argent Multisig is a secure n-of-m multisig account implementation for Starknet that requires multiple signatures to authorize any operation.

Unlike other multisigs, this account leverages account abstraction, so the account can pay for its own transaction fees.

The account is controlled by multiple owners (or `signers`). The number of owners that need to approve an operation is called the `threshold`.

A valid account signature is a list of `threshold` individual owner signatures. This account signature can be used to validate a Starknet transaction or an off-chain message through the `is_valid_signature` method.

Any operation that changes the security parameters of the account, like adding/removing/changing owners, upgrading, or changing the threshold will also require the approval (signature) of `threshold` owners.

By default the account can execute a sequence of operations such as calling external contracts in a multicall. A multicall will fail if one of the inner call fails. Whenever a function of the account must be called (`add_signers`, `remove_signers`, `upgrade`, etc), it should be the only call performed in this multicall.

## Signer types

The account owners can be of different types. There's more information about it in [Signers](signers_and_signatures.md#multiple-signer-types).

## Signature format

The information available in [Signatures](signers_and_signatures.md#signatures) is also applicable for the argent multisig. The array provided as a signature must contain **exactly** `threshold` signatures and every owner can only sign once. Moreover, to simplify processing, the **signatures need to be ordered** by signer guid, in ascending order.

## Accurate Estimates

The argent multisig can do accurate estimates for transactions before `threshold` signatures are collected. See [Accurate Estimates](accurate_estimates.md) for more information.

## Self-deployment

The account can pay the transaction fee for its own deployment. In this scenario, the multisig only requires the signature of one of the owners. This allows for better UX.

**For extra safety, it's recommended to deploy the account before depositing large amounts in the account**.

## Upgrade

To enable the model to evolve, the account implements an `upgrade` function that will upgrade to the new class\_hash. Calling this method, as any other method, requires the approval from `threshold` owners.

## Outside Execution

In addition to regular Starknet transactions, the account also can be used via meta-transactions as specified by SNIP-9. See [Outside Execution](outside_execution.md)

## Recovery

Theres is an opt-in feature to enable recovering lost accounts. See [Multisig Recovery](multisig_recovery.md)
